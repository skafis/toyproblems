// By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1
//and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
// For example, the first ten Fibonacci numbers are:
// 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34

//What to do:
// Write a Java function that accepts a number and returns the number at that position 
//in the fibonnaci sequence.
//in your solution, print out the first 15 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
public class fibonacci {
	public static void main (String[] args){
